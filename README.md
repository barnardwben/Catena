# catena
Catena's goal is to help organize and manage one's projects and the tasks related to them.

Catena was built with vanilla JS, using the module pattern and Functional/OOP programming to ensure SOLID design code.

Tools
 <ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS/SASS</li>
  <li>JS</li>
  <li>Webpack</li>
  <li>Adobe CC for video editing</li>
</ul>

The challenge with this project was layering the multiple components within each other to create the Workspace > Card Type > Card functionality.

What I would like to add in the future is Authentication, as well as search functionality to improve the workflow for the users.
